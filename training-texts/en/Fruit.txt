Fruit (Latin fructus - fruit) is a juicy edible plant fruit. Fruits are an important component of human and many animal food.

The word "fruit" did not exist in Old Russian, it appeared only in 1705, this is a borrowing through the gender. fruct from Latin fructus; any fruits were called vegetables or ovoshty.

"Fruit" is not a botanical term, but a household and economic term. In the household, edible plants and edible parts of plants are divided into fruits, vegetables, nuts, berries, grain crops, etc. In the everyday sense, a berry is also a juicy fruit; Berries can be considered a subspecies of fruit, along with pome fruits (quince, apple, etc.), stone fruits (plum, cherry, etc.), citrus fruits (orange, lemon, etc.), and subtropical and tropical fruits (pineapple, banana, etc.) [1]. The difference between a berry and a fruit can be made by size, so when eating berries, they are taken with two fingers and put into the mouth whole [5].

In some languages, the concept of "fruit" is not distinguished from the concept of "fruit", which denotes the organ of angiosperms containing seeds, formed from the ovary of a flower, regardless of edibility and juiciness.

The branch of agriculture that deals with the cultivation of perennial fruit crops to obtain fruits (as well as nuts and berries) is fruit growing.
