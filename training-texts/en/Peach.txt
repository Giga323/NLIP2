Peach (from Latin persicus, "Persian") is a soft, juicy fleshy fruit, the fruit of the peach tree. Previously, all modern subspecies and varieties cultivated for their edible fruit (pavia, brugnon, honi, bian-tao and others) were classified as one species - the common peach. Recently, the Fergana peach (Prunus ferganensis) has been singled out as a separate species.
