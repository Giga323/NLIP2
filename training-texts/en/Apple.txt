An apple is a juicy fruit of the apple tree, which is eaten fresh or baked, and is used as a raw material in cooking and for making drinks. The most widespread is the domestic apple tree, less commonly grown is the plum-leaved apple tree. The size of the red, green, yellow or orange spherical fruits is 5-13 cm in diameter. It comes from Central Asia, where the wild ancestor of the domestic apple tree, the Sievers apple tree, still grows. Today, there are many varieties of this type of apple tree, growing in different climatic conditions. According to the ripening time, summer, autumn and winter varieties are distinguished, later varieties are distinguished by good durability. The Russian word "apple" arose as a result of adding the prosthetic initial j to the Old Slavonic *ablъko; The latter was formed with the suffix -ъk, from the late Proto-Indo-European stem *āblu "apple" (the same stem is used for Lit. obuolỹs, Latvian ābols, English apple, German Apfel, Gaulish avallo, Old Irish aball). This stem is a regionalism of the northwestern Indo-European languages ​​and in turn goes back to the common Indo-European stem (reconstructed as *(a)masl-[4] or as *ŝamlu-[3]). With the suffix -onь-, the same stem gave the words "yabloń" (later - "yabloń").
